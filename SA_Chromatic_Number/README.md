## Chromatic Number of a Graph

This assignment was based around graph theory, specifically he concepts of breadth-first search and chromatic numbers.  Using a political map of South America and an abstracted graph representing the same, we were to:

1. Generate an adjacency matrix;
2. Create a Graph class that can use this as its internal representation and perform breadth-first searching;
3. Derive a Map class which can read in the list of countries and colors, and use those to calculate the chromatic number of the graph.
